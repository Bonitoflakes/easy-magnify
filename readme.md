<p>The inspiration is taken from other package that has not been updated since last 3-4 years and many people seem to use it till now even after it conflicts with React 17 & 18.
If you like this package then make sure to give it some stars.</p>

<p>If you have nice knowledge of react and you wanna contribute then you can do so but send me email through my portfolio. Maybe I won't maintain it for too long because of my business reasons but i want this to be improved and continued as an open source project.</p>

<p>For issue: open issues on github.</p>
